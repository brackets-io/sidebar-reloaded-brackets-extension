Sidebar Reloaded Dev
=========

All the changes made with this extension are purely CSS.

## Changelog
+ Font size from 13px to 14px
+ Tweaked colors to be more consistent visually
+ Larger project files button
+ Replaced arrow sprite sheet arrows with a unicode arrow
+ Animated arrow rotation
+ Everything is on an 8x8 pixel grid
+ Cleaned up jsTree's non-lessy file which also reduced file size

## Todo
+ Animated dropdown height in the file tree (this will require some js tweaks)
+ Clean up styles in the working files
+ Make the projects button full width
+ Remove the sprite sheet from the projects button
+ File file tree selection width from lagging when dragging out the sidebar
+ Show/hide menu option for the right bar and bottom bar

## How to set up?
1. I installed the dev build of Brackets from GitHub and removed `jsTree.less` from the styles folder. This gives me a nearly completely un-styled project file tree for this extension to build upon.
2. Now install the extension.
